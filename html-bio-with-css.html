      <p>After spending over 14 years in EMS I made the decision to change careers. I've always had an interest in computers and figured why not get into a career in tech. 
        I'm currently enrolled in the University of Denver's coding bootcamp. While there I intend to learn as much as possible and hopefully land a job shortly after. After 
        the bootcamp I plan to self study any other languages I may not have learned and eventually learn information security, potentially from another boot camp at DU.
        I'm excited to see the realm of possibilities that the tech industry has in store.
